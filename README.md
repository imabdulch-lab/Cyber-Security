# Cyber-Security
I have built a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of my learning journey. This project helped me strengthen my Cyber Security skills and better understand real-world Cyber Security Scenarios.
I would like to sincerely thank my seniors and mentors Abdullah Rashid, Muhammad Akmal & Muzammil Iqbal for their constant guidance, feedback and motivation.
